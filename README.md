# AI for Fake News Detection in Social Networks

Fake news are not a new thing, there are documents that prove their usage in politics at least since Cicerone 64 BC. According to the most recent behavioral psychology research fake news are todayâ€™s winning communication strategy for politicians. In this paper we briefly present a few psychological and historical concepts that will be the foundation for any AI technique to solve the problem. Then we review the 2 most common techniques used today (2021). And finally we propose our detection schema which implements novel Machine Learning approaches in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify if a text is either a Fake news or not.
